A prediction of what types of organism will thrive and why you have that prediction
The average cooperation mean for each type of organism and the average of averages.
Whether or not the results support your prediction and why.

1. Size 10: 1 cooperators, 9 defectors, 0 partialCooperators
    Prediction: I feel the defectors are more likely to thrive becasue the copperator will share its
                energy but the defectors will not.
    Results: Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0
    I believe the results support my prediction because the defectors are more likely to thrive

2. Size 10: 9 cooperators, 1 defectors, 0 partialCooperators
    Prediction: I feel the cooperators are more likely to thrive becasue the copperator will share its
                energy and will reproduce.
    Results: Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.8
    I believe the results support my prediction even though not all the time cooperatorsthrive but most of the time

3. Size 10: 4 cooperators, 3 defectors, 3 partialCooperators
    Prediction: I feel the cooperators are more likely to thrive becasue the copperator will share its
                energy and will reproduce.
    Results: Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.5
    the results don't support my prediction because the partialCooperators are more likely to thrive

4. Size 100: 1 cooperators, 99 defectors, 0 partialCooperators
    Prediction: I feel the defectors are more likely to thrive becasue the copperator will share its
                energy but the defectors will not.
    Results: Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.0
    I believe the results support my prediction because the defectors are more likely to thrive

5. Size 100: 99 cooperators, 1 defectors, 0 partialCooperators
    Prediction: I feel the cooperators are more likely to thrive becasue the copperator will share its
                energy and will reproduce.
    Results: Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.9
    I believe the results support my prediction even though not all the time cooperatorsthrive but most of the time

6. Size 100: 44 cooperators, 33 defectors, 33 partialCooperators 
    Prediction: I feel the cooperators are more likely to thrive becasue the copperator will share its
                energy and will reproduce.
    Results: Mean Cooperation Probability = 0.027727273
    the results don't support my prediction because the partialCooperators and the defectors thrived more while the cooperators did not


From all the experiments conducted I feel that the defectors thrive the most because the cooperators share the energy ith them and they
reproduce. However, the copperators can only reproduce if they receive enough energy from each other. The partialCooperators are more tricky but I feel they
lean to the defectors side more as they thrive.
